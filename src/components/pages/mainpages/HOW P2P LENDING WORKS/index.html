        <p class="containerp">Peer-to-peer Lending is a system that connects people seeking to invest money with borrowers looking for a loan.
          By cutting out the bank in the middle,
          investors earn a healthy return from principal and interest payments
           while helping others achieve their goals. This generally provides higher returns to the investors
           relative to other types of investments such as Mutual Funds, Banks etc and it helps to match up investors with borrowers looking for a personal loan,
           all of whom been vetted in advance for credit worthiness.</p>
